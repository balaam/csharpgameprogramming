# Introduction #

This repository is for the code accompanying the book
[C# Game Programming: For Serious Game Creation](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1435455568/ref=nosim?tag=dansspiels-21)

OpenGL and C# are used to build a fast hardware accelerated 2D engine with an example scrolling shooter game.


# Details #

To run the code:
  * Download all the source and examples
  * Make sure you've got the latest greatest version of the [.NET libraries.](http://www.microsoft.com/net/download.aspx)
  * Install [Tao](http://sourceforge.net/projects/taoframework/) and [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/?p=download)
  * The Engine project is just a library of code, to see anything you'll want to run the Shooter example.
  * In your bin\debug and bin\release directory you should have the following .dll files, some will be copied in automatically some you'll have to find in Tao installation directory:
    * alut.dll
    * DevIL.dll
    * Engine.dll (this will be auto-generated by the Engine library.)
    * ILU.dll
    * ILUT.dll
    * OpenAL32.dll
    * SDL.dll

Once this done you should be ready to develop!

# How you can help #

Your  first step should be to dash over to amazon and [grab a copy of the book](http://sourceforge.net/projects/taoframework/) - then you can join in on all the fun :D If you think you've got something cool to add let me know. It would be nice to get rid of the shoddy programmer art :D
(If you're a reasonably experienced programmer you can probably just grab the source and get the jist of things without the book - not, of course, the recommended method :D)
